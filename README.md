# Flight Search Engine

## Intro

The program helps clients of the company to find flight tickets that meet their
requirements.

This is a student team project aimed at demonstrating skills in teamwork and software development in the Clojure language.

## Disclaimer 

This programme is a study project, the data is mock, the authors do not bear any responsibility to the users of this program.

## How it works

The program is built on top of Clojure â€” a dynamic and functional dialect of the Lisp programming language that has JVM as the VM.

### Algorithms

The program functionality is based on an optimized depth-first search with subsequent filtering of results based on input parameters. That is, the result is always the best result.

### Project Structure

```
.
+-- _Core
|   +-- Core.clj
|   +-- Entities.clj
```
The core of the program, all calculations are made in this part of the code base. The Entities file is a set of structures that are used to transfer data between the adapter and the core.

```
.
+-- _Adapters
|   +-- CsvDataAdapter
```
Adapters. These scripts enable the user to import data from external sources into a format that can be understood by the program core.

```
.
+-- _Datasets
|   +-- flights-ICA1.csv
```
This is where the datasets are located.

```
.
+-- Main.clj
```
The program Entry Point.


## Getting Started

### Installation
#### 1. Uses REPL mode
1. Clone the repository into your Clojure project.
2. Run REPL
3. Enter the program's namespace

```clojure
> (use 'PCU_SC_ICA_1_2023.Main)
> (in-ns 'PCU_SC_ICA_1_2023.Main)
```
3. Call the function in a terminal with arguments (departure city, arrival city and type)

```clojure
> (prepare-travel-plan "Prague" "Berlin" "g")
```
#### 2. Uses as a library
1. Clone the repository into your Clojure project.
2. Import the program entry point namespace
```clojure
(ns [your-namespace]
    (:require [PCU_SC_ICA_1_2023.Main :as FlightEngine])
  )
```
3. Call the function in your code with arguments (departure city, arrival city and type)
```clojure
(FlightEngine/prepare-travel-plan "Prague" "Berlin" "g")
```
